## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Requirements

* MySQL Server (v5.7+ recommended)
* MySQL Workbench or any SQL GUI
* XAMPP / WAMP (optional for PHP/Apache integration)

### 2. Steps to Run

#### Importing the Database

1. Open **MySQL Workbench** or your preferred SQL tool.
2. Create a new database (e.g., `CollegeDB`).
